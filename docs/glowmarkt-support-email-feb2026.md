Hi,

I'm a Bright app user and I've noticed that my smart meter data has stopped coming through since approximately 5th February 2026.

**Account:** benclark.mail@gmail.com

**What I'm seeing:**
- Electricity: Only showing tiny readings (0.15-0.23 kWh/day) since Feb 5, when normal usage is 13-25+ kWh/day
- Gas: Showing zero readings since Feb 5, when normal usage is 25+ kWh/day
- The Bright app also shows no data for this period
- Last full day of data was 4th February

**Previous data was fine** - I have consistent half-hourly readings for both electricity and gas going back to late December 2024, all working perfectly until this point.

Could you please check whether my DCC connection is still active and if the meters are communicating with the comms hub correctly? Happy to provide any additional details needed.

Thanks,
Ben Clark
