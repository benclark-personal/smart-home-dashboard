# Glowmarkt Support Request - Historical Data

**Subject:** Request for Historical Gas Data Backfill + Extended Electricity History

---

Hi,

I recently registered my smart meters with the Bright app (account: benclark.mail@gmail.com) on 25th December 2024.

I'm successfully receiving electricity consumption data going back approximately 13 months via the API, which is working well. However, I have two requests:

**1. Gas Historical Data**
My gas consumption data only shows recent readings - historical data appears to be missing. I understand that gas meter data backfill through the DCC can be slower than electricity. Would it be possible to manually trigger a full historical backfill for my gas meter?

**2. Extended Electricity History**
I currently have ~13 months of electricity data. Is there any additional historical electricity data available beyond this? I'd be grateful for any further data that can be retrieved.

My meter details:
- **Supplier:** E.ON
- **Meter Type:** SMETS2
- Gas resource ID: 695a8307-7f36-4a47-985d-761136c79028
- Electricity resource ID: d32d26bc-b8f8-4f43-b098-49aa174f6df7

I'm using the data for home energy monitoring and would really appreciate having the full history available for both meters.

Thank you for your help.

Best regards,
Ben Clark
